<h1 class ="one"><center>Ghosts and Greys</center></h1>

I designed this site to serve both as somewhere a newcomer to the subject can get an <a href="{% url 'pages:intro' %}" class="baselinks">Introduction</a> to it and as somewhere that people already acquianted with the subject can get the latest news and express their own opinions. It's nowhere near finished and this is just an early version of it, if there is any interest i'll be adding blog posts, UFO news, and possibly a forum as well. Just testing the waters for now but thank you for looking and i appreciate any feedback via reddit u/Pandammonia.</p>

<h2 class="one">State of this website (IMPORTANT)</h2>
<p class ="one">Currently this website is in development and this is just a a very very early version of it with somewhat limited functionality, there was a forum but i wasn't happy with it at the time of uploading so i removed it's access, so whilst you're free to register if you want there's really no benefit or need as of right now. I plan to add a forum and various other features but please bear with me. If you have any suggestions or anything you would like to see available I can always be reached via PM on reddit at u/Pandammonia, or you can just send me an email at pandammonia@outlook.com, thank you for visiting : )</p>
